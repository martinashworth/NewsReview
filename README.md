Documentation
-------------

At this stage there isn't any Documentation.  This is for my purposes, not yours. <br />

However, in an attempt to make the code more readable, object names are prefixed as follows, in order to identify their type: <br />

att = attribute (of a class) <br />
dct = dictionary <br />
fcn = function <br />
ins = instance (of a class) <br />
int = integer <br />
lst = list <br />
mod = module <br />
str = string <br />

Support
-------

Nor is there any Support.  You're on your own, but you'll figure it out.

Code of Conduct
---------------

No Code of Conduct either.  Just be excellent to each other, and behave until I work out what all this means.
