Documentation
-------------

At this stage there isn't any Documentation.  This is for my purposes, not yours.

Support
-------

Nor is there any Support.  You're on your own, but you'll figure it out.

Code of Conduct
---------------

No Code of Conduct either.  Just behave until I work out what all this means.
